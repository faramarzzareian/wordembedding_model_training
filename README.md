# Text Summarization Model Generator

This is a simple implementation of text summarization using word embeddings in Python with the gensim library.
#Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    gensim 4.3.0 or higher

## Installation

### You can install the required packages by running the following command:

pip install gensim

## Usage

    First, you need to preprocess the text by converting it to lowercase and splitting it into words. You can do this using the preprocess_text function.

    Then, you can train the word embedding model using the gensim.models.Word2Vec function. You need to pass in the preprocessed text list, along with other parameters such as window size, minimum count of words, and number of workers.

    Finally, you can save the model to disk using the save method.

## Code Explanation

    preprocess_text function takes in a text string and returns a list of words after lowercasing and tokenizing it.

    text_list contains a list of sample texts that you want to summarize.

    preprocessed_text_list is a list of preprocessed texts obtained by applying the preprocess_text function to each text in text_list.

    model is an instance of gensim.models.Word2Vec, which is trained on the preprocessed_text_list.

    The model is then saved to disk with the file name word_embedding_model.

#### Note: This code is just a starting point and can be further extended and optimized to build a more robust text summarization system.
